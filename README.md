<h1> SwiftUI Basics with weather App </h1>

<p> "I'm designing a simple weather app using Swift. Along the way, I'll be noting down interesting distinctions and unique features I encounter between Swift, the language I'm using for iOS app development, and Python, another programming language I'm familiar with." </p>

<h3> bool data type</h3>
<p> In swift language the bool data type has a toggle method, this is fascianting as in python I have had to create modifiers to manually toggle bool values in classes</p>

<h3> Views Limit per stack</h3>
<p> There is a limit to the amounbt of views that can exist within the ZStack, Vstack or Hstack, refactoring your stacks can help solve this. spacing is including as a view in swiftUI</p>

<h3> for loop restrictions </h3>
<p> Even after reading and finally understanding the difference beference between declarative syntax and implerative, my dumass tried using traditional for loop within the body of a view and spent hours making it work. Swift provides a ForEach method as a convenient way to iterate over a collection of data </p>
